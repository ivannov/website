title: Give your Plugin a name

h1. Give your Plugin a name

Each plugin should be given a name. This is done by adding the @@org.jboss.seam.forge.shell.plugins.Alias@ annotation to your plugin class.

By default, if no @@Alias@ annotation is found, the lower-case Class name will be used; for instance, our @ExamplePlugin@, above, would be executed by typing:

bc(command). $ exampleplugin

p. Now we will add a name to our plugin.

bc(prettyprint linenums).. @Alias("example")
public class ExamplePlugin implements Plugin {
   // commands
}

p. Our named @@Alias("example") ExamplePlugin@ would be executed by typing:

bc(command). $ example{code}
